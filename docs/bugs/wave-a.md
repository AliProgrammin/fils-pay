# Wave A bug fixes

### A1 Login works without the OTP
- Severity: Critical
- Ticket: none
- Where: apps/api/src/auth/sessions.ts:89
- What is wrong: `lookupSession` accepts a session that has not passed the OTP step.
- Why it happens: The query reads the `live_sessions` view. That view only removes revoked and expired rows. It keeps rows with `authenticated = false`. The query never checks that column.
- What it breaks: `/v1/auth/login` sets the session cookie after the password check only. With that cookie, an attacker who knows the password can call every merchant route without the OTP. Two-factor login is fully bypassed.
- Fix: Add `AND s.authenticated = true` to the lookup query.
- Test: apps/api/src/auth/sessions.test.ts, "lookupSession returns null for a pending session that never passed the OTP"
